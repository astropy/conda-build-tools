Remember to set these things before your start your first build:

- [ ] Set `DESTINATION_CONDA_CHANNEL` in both `appveyor.yml` and `.travis.yml`.
- [ ] Set `BINSTAR_TOKEN` in both `appveyor.yml` and `.travis.yml`. This will require you to set those tokens up on appveyor and travis.
- [ ] Change the name of the conda channel below or remove it altogether.

# For users

To install the conda packages maintained in this repository, add the conda channel for this repository to your list of default channels:

```

```

# For maintainers/contributors

## Dependencies

This packages uses `extruder`, available on GitHub at
[astropy/conda-build-tools](https://github.com/astropy/conda-build-tools) or installable
with: `conda install -c astropy extruder`.

## Updating an existing package to a new version

Edit the version number in `requirements.yml`: by far the easiest way is to
open [`requirements.yml`](requirements.yml) in GitHub, click the pencil icon
to edit it, and create a pull request to make the change.

## Adding a new package

First try adding the new package to `requirements.yml`. If the build based on
that fails you will need to write a recipe for it, then do some minor editing
to convert it to a template.

Check out the
[home page for the builder](https://github.com/astropy/conda-build-tools)
for a description of the permitted fields in `requirements.yml` and a sample recipe template.
